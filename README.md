Some background:

"The commercialization of the geospatial industry has led to an explosive amount of data being collected to 
characterize our changing planet. One area for innovation is the application of computer vision and 
deep learning to extract information from satellite imagery at scale. The SpaceNet Partners, CosmiQ Works, 
DigitalGlobe and Radiant Solutions have partnered to release the SpaceNet Off-Nadir dataset to the public 
to enable developers and data scientists.

Today, map features such as roads, building footprints, and points of interest are primarily created through 
manual techniques. We believe that advancing automated feature extraction techniques will serve important 
downstream uses of map data. For example, this type of map data is needed for planning international events 
like the 2016 Rio Olympics, as well as humanitarian and disaster response as recently observed in Haiti to 
aid the response to Hurricane Matthew. Furthermore, we think that solving this challenge is an important 
stepping stone to unleashing the power of advanced computer vision algorithms applied to a variety of 
remote sensing data applications in both the public and private sector.
